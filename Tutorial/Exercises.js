//Now, lets practice together!
//#1
function RemoveHashtag(input){
var x = //Try to remove the hashtag from the input!
console.log(x[0] + " " + x[1])

var array = ["B", "C", "A"];
var x = //Here, sort the array and log it to the console!
}

function NaN(input){
    if(/*Here, check if the input is a number!*/){
        //If it's not, return to the console that the parameter isn't a number!
    } else {
        //Else, print to the console what the number is!
    }
}

NaN(//Put your value here to check if your code works!)

function SquareRoot(input){
    //Here, we will want to check the square root of a number. I will help you with this one.
    var x = Math.sqrt(input);
    //Now, I want you to print the result in the console.

    var y = //Here, I want you to raise the number back to normal (raise it to square).
}

SquareRoot(2);

//#5
//The last one, and the hardest.
//Here, you will make an entire function by your own.
//This function will take 2 parameters (inputs) and check if they are numbers.
//If they aren't number, then you will return a console.log() saying that the parameters aren't numbers.
//Else, you will make a multiplication with those 2 numbers and raise it to square.
//Then, print on the console the result of this problem. Good luck!
